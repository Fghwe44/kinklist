# Saving

Verify that saving the kinklist will work fine if it gets edited


New fields spawn un-edited
Old fields might...
 * Add Migrations?
 * Create a checklist in the side "todo / now missing"



# Different rankings for Self/Partner

E.g. Aftercare

Self:
 * Need
 * Want
 * Like
 * NEVER

Partner
 * Like
 * Dislike
 * Limit
 * (the normal list)



# Tagging

All categories have tags (using the name as a default). Any item in it has the tag automatically.
Categories can be given "synonym" tags. Also Tags have a seperate section that lets you define synonyms

A kink entry can be also be given OTHER tags, (you can add the same one for redundancy)
This means it will show up in ALL the categories


## Hard NO 
Mark something as "HARD NO" and it disappears from ALL categories
showing up in a "show more" tiny expander

But mark a category (Humiliation) as HARD NO, and it still shows in others...
but with a "Hard no" background on the entry
so you can cross it off quickly, or decide that "oh thats an exception"


## Extreme Tag

Marks Taboo / Extreme content. This lets you PRE-HIDE sections for the more basic kinklist

Kinklist Types:
 * Basic
 * Detailed
 * Taboo

Desires:
1. Parent categories:   Fluids  (Blood, Watersports, Scat,... ) With the parent category allowing you to basically HIDE an entire category if its in "Hard Limit".
BUT if you check off some inside the child off, and it will show anyway.

2. Different rankings for some:

2a) "not Entered" should not be a choice. Click again to remove (hover shows the X on cur colour)
2b) Favourite, Like, Indifferent, Dislike, Maybe (Soft Limit), Never (Hard Limit)
2c) ALSO a secondary choice for them: "Curious"

3) Instead of "different kinklists" you should be able to Add in groups (different txt files):

3a) BDSM
3b) Taboo
3d) Roleplay
3e) Appearance
3f) Outfits
just some to keep in mind
